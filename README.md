General Plan:

-Need two grids; one for each player. Also need title, and number of ships destroyed on the side.

Using ejs loops, can fill up board with css grid elements that are all the same size, but each with a specific ID.
This ID will have an x and y coordinate. Use <% %> ejs loops for this.

Each ship will be associated with a particular series of IDs. It should be possible to split an image of a ship into multiple pieces, and combine them across grids.
Once one part is hit, the colour can change.
